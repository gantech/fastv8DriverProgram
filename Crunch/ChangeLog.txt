                          Crunch Change Log
                          -----------------

v1.00  09-Jul-1998  Marshall Buhl
 Created from GenStats, GPP, and Z40Crunch.  The initial version
 includes individual and aggregate statistics and histograms.  It also
 includes summary statistics.

v1.10  24-Jul-1998  M. Buhl
 Added GPP's rainflow routines.

v1.20  28-Jul-1998  M. Buhl
 Modified to output azimuth averages and to do azimuth averages of aggregates.

v1.21  28-Jul-1998  M. Buhl
 Modified some of the status messages.

v1.22  30-Jul-1988  M. Buhl
 Modified Crunch to allow it to deal with files with no wind-speed channel.

v1.23  04-Aug-1988  M. Buhl
 Fixed bug by adding calculation of range bin widths for non-normalized
 rainflow cycle counting.  Changed output for tab-delimited, 1-D rainflow
 results so that zero counts come out as blanks to make plotting easier for
 log plots.

v1.30  05-Aug-1988  M. Buhl
 Added calculated channels.  Fixed a bug in the creation of column
 labels for 2-D rainflow cycle counting.  Modified the certification
 test procedure some.

v1.31  06-Aug-1988  M. Buhl
 Change the value for the constant Gamma that is used for calculated
 channels so that it is no longer incorrect.

v1.32  07-Aug-1988  M. Buhl
 Fixed the formatting of output for tab-delimited, rainflow files.

v1.33  12-Aug-1998  M. Buhl
 Fixed some of the header information for 1-D RF output.  I also redid
 CertTest.bat and increased the number of tests to 6.

v1.40  13-Aug-1998  M. Buhl
 Added the ability to output RF cycles instead of binned cycles.  I had to
 convert the statistics arrays to include the file number as a dimension.

v1.41  22-Oct-1998  M. Buhl
 Changed azimuth averaging so that the azimuth values are the mean values
 instead of the bin centers.

v1.42  29-Jan-1999  M. Buhl
 When reading in the calculated-channels info, I was incrementing the number
 of input columns instead of the total number of columns.  The AA column
 counting had to be redone to account for calculated channels.  I fixed the
 warning message for when the modified-output file couldn't be opened.  It
 was appending the ".mod" to the file name instead of the root name.  I added
 units to the modified-output file.

v1.50  01-Apr-1999  D. Laino
 Added code to extrapolate extreme values using method developed by Peter
 Madsen of Riso.  Technique is not yet validated.  The input file format
 has changed - each output column for which a separate summary statistic
 file is desired is listed on a separate line.  (For 0 columns, there should
 be zero lines used.)

v1.51  06-Apr-1999  M. Buhl
 I modified the output in the .ext files so that they were easier to read
 and more consistent with other output files.

v1.60  06-Apr-1999  M. Buhl
 I moved the statistical-extrapolation information in the input file from
 the summary-file section to its own section.

v1.61  13-Apr-1999  D. Laino
 Added check that time to extrapolate out to is longer than the data set
 in order to avoid log of infinity error.

v1.70  16-Apr-1999  D. Laino
 Under suggestion from Kirk Pierce, the outputs of the extrapolation
 routine were changed to include expected values during the base period,
 and the equation for calculating the value for any quantile.  The input
 file changed to include a request for one quantile for each column.
 Calculation of the quantiles for the data table was corrected as well.

v1.71  28-May-1999  M. Buhl, D. Laino
 Changed AzimAver so that it generates a value for IB_Hi between 1 and
 NumAABins.  It was failing before when IB_Lo was NumAABins-1.  I used
 the technique from GenStats.  Changed extrapolation routines to use
 method proposed by the team at Stanford University - taking the mean
 of extrapolation values from each data set.  Changed the output accordingly.
 Included standard error in the output.  Eliminated recurrence interval
 calculation, and added "T"-extrapolation.

v1.72  01-Jun-1999  D. Laino
 Added calculation for the standard deviation in azimuth average routines.
 Added Peter Madsen's azimuth binning method to extrapolation routines.

v1.73  16-Jun-1999  M. Buhl
 Modified the error message for when reading the time column.  If zero
 was entered, then the message said it had to be between 0 and N inclusive.
 I changed it so it said 1 and N.  I should probably modify the code so
 that a zero signifies no time column.

v1.74  26-Jun-1999  M. Buhl
 I modified the ProgVer string so that it can handle alpha versions.  I
 had to modify many routines to TRIM() it whenever we output it to account
 to variable lengths.  I modified GetValue() in Parser.f90 so that it tests
 only the second argument to see if it's zero.  I also fixed a minor bug in
 StatOut, where we  were incorrectly outputting a "-aa" string for calculated
 channels.

v1.80  20-Jul-1999  M. Buhl
 Besides celebrating the 30th anniversary of the first lunar landing, I
 ported GPP's IIR filtering routine to Crunch.  This created a new file
 called "filter.f90".  I added a new section to the input file to
 accommodate it.  I updated the certification test suite to include the
 changes.

v1.81  25-Oct-1999  M. Buhl
 After Gene Quandt reported that he got an error message when he set both
 the mean and range bins to zero, I changed the test for the mean bins so
 that the value was ignored when the number of range bins was set to zero.

v1.90  30-Aug-2000  M. Buhl
 I changes all occurences of "Wr_Scr1" in all files to "WrScr1".  I also
 changed "Wr_Scr" to "WrScr".
 I modified Modules.f90 to create the logical, allocatable arrays
 AutoRange and AutoMeans.  I modified the input file and GetParams() in
 Crunch.f90 to allow users to set the max range and/or the min mean and
 max mean.  I modified RF_Init() in Rainflow.f90 to move the allocation
 of the MaxRng, MaxMean, and MinMean arrays to GetParams() in Crunch.f90.
 I also modified BinCount1() and BinCount2() in Rainflow.f90 to not
 calculate the max range if it was user specified.  I modified
 BinCount2() to not calculate the min and max means if they were user
 specfied.  I moved the deallocation of the MaxRange, MaxMean, and MinMean
 arrays from Rainflow() to the Crunch() in Crunch.f90.
 I changed the verification tests to reflect the new input files.  I
 changed Test06 so that it would not autocalculate the MaxRange for
 channel 4 and the MinMean and MaxMean for channel 5.

v2.00  20-Sep-2000  M. Buhl
 I added a new feature that generates extreme events for a design-loads
 document.  I made changes to Crunch(), Alloc(), and GetParams() in
 Crunch.f90.  I added a new file, "ExtEvent.f90", to the project that
 contains most of the new code.  I added some new parameters to Modules.f90
 and a new section to the input file.  I added two runs to the certification
 test.

v2.10  05-Oct-2000  M. Buhl
 I added a new feature that generates load roses.  I made changes to
 Crunch() and GetParams() in Crunch.f90.  I added a new file,
 "LoadRose.f90", to the project that contains most of the new code.  I
 added some new parameters to Modules.f90 and a new section to the input
 file.  I also had to change StatOut() in Stats.f90 so that the total
 number of rose columns was added to the IF tests to see if the column
 was a special azimuth-average column.
 I added a new global variable, NonAACols, to make some stuff a little
 easier and had to change crunch.f90, stats.f90, and modules.f90.
 I moved the input of the time and wind-speed columns to be after the
 input for the calculated channels so that they could be a calculated
 channel if necessary.
 I changed the certification-test input files and modified tests 9 and 10
 so they included load roses.  Test 10 also includes a calculated channel.

v2.20  06-Oct-2000  M. Buhl
 I added the ability to specify fixed bins for the PDF (aka, histogram)
 feature.  I renamed the PDF variables from something involving
 histogramming to using PDF.  I also redid some of the logic.  I renamed
 histgram.f90 to pdf.f90.  Files modified were crunch.f90, pdf.f90, and
 modules.f90.  In crunch.f90, I modified Alloc() and GetParams().  This
 new capability involved changing the input file slightly.  I updated all
 the certification-test input files.
 I discovered that algorithm was mispelled as algorith all over the code
 and had to change many routines in many files to fix it.

v2.30  13-Oct-2000  M. Buhl
 With Craig Hansen's urging, I added the ability for Crunch to auto-detect
 the format of the data files.  Now, you can ask Crunch to simply use all
 the columns in the input file instead of telling it how many are in the
 file and how many of them you want to use.

 In addition to auto-detecting columns, Crunch can also auto-detect the
 number of rows in the file.  If you specify a time column and a start
 and end time, Crunch will use only the lines with times in that range.
 For multiple-file runs, all files must have the same form.  If time is
 used to limit the data, Crunch will assume the times are all on the same
 rows for all files.  If a file comes up short or has a read error, Crunch
 will skip that file and not use any of its data.

 These changes required many changes to some of the fundamental way Crunch
 works.  I had to change most of the routines in Crunch.f90.  I had to
 change all routines that generated output data because not all runs have
 units.  I added CountWords() and GetWords() to GenUse.f90.  I added
 CheckInp(), DetectCols(), and DetectRecs() to Crunch.f90.  This is a
 MAJOR revision of the code, so I may have introduced some new bugs.  To
 find many of them, I added new versions of the 10 test cases that use
 auto-detection of both (usually) columns and rows.  This uncovered two
 days worth of bugs to fix.  I did not take time to make sure Crunch
 still detects all input errors.  I'll leave that for the users.

v2.31  06-Nov-2000  M. Buhl
 In GetParams() of Crunch.f90, I added more validity testing for the units
 and first-data rows.
 Dave Laino found a problem with reading the units row.  I was skipping
 one line too many after the titles row.
 While debugging David's problem, I noticed that I was exceeding subscript
 bounds in the Titles and Units arrays when I did azimuth averaging with
 auto-column detection enabled.  I created a new routine call AzimInit()
 in AzimAver.f90 to create the titles and units for the new columns created
 by the azimuth-averaging feature.  I call it from GetParams() and from
 the main program.
 I had to do something similar for calculated channels.  I fixed up and
 called (it wasn't called before) the AddCC() routine in CalcChan.f90.  I
 called it from the main program.
 I removed all calculations of TotCols and NonAACols for auto-columns
 from everything but DetectCols() in Crunch.f90.

v2.32  06-Nov-2000  M. Buhl
 As I was preparing to notify the users of the v2.31 release, I noticed
 that Crunch would crash in an inelegant fashion if I had an extra blank
 line between sections of the input file.  I modified GetParams() in
 Crunch.f90 so that I tested for an end of file whenever I read numbers
 from a line of text that had been read from the input file.

v2.33  08-Nov-2000  M. Buhl
 Dave Laino spotted that when we had a read error on a data file, the
 resulting error message always used the name of the first file.  It
 seems I had hardwired it to file one, so I fixed it in Crunch.f90\ReadData().
 While testing that, test12 bombed due to a SQRT() error in the code
 for extrapolating extreme values.  Apparently, when reading in the files,
 I never reset NumFiles to the value of GoodFiles.  I modified the main
 program to update NumFiles to fix that problem.

v2.34  27-Nov-2000  M. Buhl
 I found that when Crunch ran across a short file, it stopped reading files
 instead of simply skipping the bad file.  I had to change an "EXIT" to
 a "CYCLE" in the main program to fix it.  I also had to change ReadData()
 in Crunch.f90 so that it didn't call PremEOF() when skipping the header.
 Now, it sets the error flag and returns.  Then, I found that I was using
 the same index for both the file names and the data array.  I now call
 ReadData() with both Fi and GoodFiles.

v2.35  18-Dec-2000  M. Buhl
 I discovered that I had unintentionally changed all the tabs in ExtEvent.f90
 to spaces.  This messed up the format specifiers of tab-delimited output.
 I put the tabs back in and it seems to be working now.

v2.36  19-Dec-2000  M. Buhl
 Craig found that some of the statistics were hosed when doing aggregate
 analyses and some of the files were skipped.  I had to change an occurance
 of "NumFiles" in Stats.f90\Stats() to "GoodFiles" to fix it.
 I also found and changed an occurance of NumFiles in LoadRose.f90\LoadRose().
 I found many occurances of "NumFiles" that I had to change throughout
 ExtrValu.f90.
 I fixed one occurance in CalcChan.f90\CalcChan().
 I fixed two occurances in AzimAver.f90\AzimCalc().
 I also modified the headers of aggregate files so that it told how many
 of the requested input files were good.  This required changes to
 Stats.f90\StatOpen(), Rainflow.f90\RF_Init(), ExtrValu.f90\ExtrapOpen(),
 ExtEvent.f90\EE_Init(), and AzimAver.f90\Write_AA().
 While I was at that, I converted all the I/O statements in those routines
 to use format strings instead of FORMAT statements.
 In Crunch.f90\Crunch(), I added logic to count the number of bad input
 files (BadFiles) and to save their indices in an array (BadList).  I
 output the file names at the ends of the analyses' output files if aggregate
 analyses are done.

v2.40  04-Jan-2001  M. Buhl
 I added a moving-averages (MA) feature.  This entailed creating a new source
 file called "MoveAver.f90."  To DataMod in Modules.f90, I added the following
 variables: MAPeriod, MAChans, NumMA, MATitles, and MAUnits.  I modified
 Crunch.f90\GetParams() to include the logic for reading the input parameters.
 I modified Crunch.f90\Crunch() to initialize and calculate the MAs.  I
 also had to modify LoadRose.f90 to change all occurances of "NumCols+NumCChan"
 to "NumCols+NumCChan+NumMA".
 I improved some of the error messages in LoadRose.f90\AddRoseChan().
 I also eliminated all initialization and column checking in Crunch.f90\
 GetParams() for the case when we manually enter the column information.
 We now do it all in one place regardless of the case.  This also required
 changes to Crunch.f90\Crunch().  I eliminated the ManCols variable in DataMod
 and all references to it in Crunch.f90.
 I'll probably get complaints, but I changed the default name of the parameter-
 input file from "crunch.inp" to "param.cru".  This required changing the
 Modules\GenMod module and Crunch.f90\CheckArgs().

v2.41  05-Jan-2001  M. Buhl
 I found that I was testing the wrong number of columns in Stats.f90\SumOpen(),
 so I changed the occurances of NumCols to NonAACols.  It was messing up
 the names of the summary files when summarizing moving-averages (and probably
 calculated-channels and load roses).

v2.42  12-Jan-2001  M. Buhl
 I found that when I had a data error reading in the data, it printed out
 the wrong line number.  I fixed it in Crunch.f90\DetectRecs().

v2.50  01-Feb-2001  M. Buhl
 I added user-specified output formats.  To do so, I modified Crunch()
 and GetParams() in Crunch.f90.  I also modified the output-related
 statements in AzimAver.f90, Stats.f90, ExtEvent.f90, ExtrValu.f90,
 PDF.f90, and Rainflow.f90.
 I added the function Conv2UC() to GenUse.f90 to convert strings to
 upper case.  I added RealFmt and TextFmt strings to Modules.f90\GenMod().
 In ExtrValu.f90\ExtrapOpen(), I changed the non-standard calls of FLOAT()
 to REAL().
 I fixed a bug in Crunch.f90\GetParams() that made sure that the number
 of information columns in an extreme-event table was greater than 0.  I
 changed it so that it tested it to be >= 0, instead.

v2.51  09-Feb-2001  M. Buhl
 Dave Laino found that Crunch crashed inelegantly when one left out the
 format identifier line in the parameter file and was doing tab-delimited
 output.  I changed Crunch.f90\GetParams() so that it validated the input
 for tab-delimited output too.  I also modified that routine so that it
 makes sure we have blank lines between the blocks of data in the
 parameter file.  I also check all numerical reads in that routine so
 that they test for invalid numerical input.  Hopefully, these last two
 things will catch most errors in the parameter file.

v2.52  02-Mar-2001  M. Buhl
 Herb Sutherland found two errors in the Rainflow routines.  One is that
 when doing tab-delimited output, the string holding the format of the
 output was too short.  I increased the length of Fmt from 20 to 30
 characters in Rainflow.f90\Rainflow().  The other was that when one
 selects a rainflow counting period that was not a whole number of minutes,
 hours, etc., and was not less than 60, the string holding the period
 never got set.  Now, PerString is set to some number of seconds if it's
 and oddball time > 60 seconds.  That fix occurred in Rainflow.f90\RF)Init().

v2.60  29-Mar-2001  M. Buhl
 I changed output for RF bins with zero counts so that users can choose
 between zeros and spaces for tab-delimited files.  This required
 creation of a new flag (RFZC_Blank) in Modules.f90\DataMod().  I had to
 modify Crunch.f90\Get_Params() to read the new flag.  I also modified
 Rainflow.f90\Rainflow() to use it.  While working on this, I discovered
 a bug in Rainflow() that crops up when the RealFmt produces numbers
 wider than 10 or 11 characters.  I increased the sizes of Fmt and CR_Str
 to be 30 characters.  This made the output look very strange when seen
 with an editor, so I put a TRIM() around CR_Str in the WRITE statements.
 While at it, I also left-adjusted the numbers to reduce the output.  The
 one file I checked was 14% smaller than the one produced by  the
 previous version, while still looking exactly the same once imported
 into Excel.
 Being annoyed with the fact that the probability-density-function
 output files had a .pdf extension, which happens to belong to Adobe
 Printed Document Format files, I decided to look for a better name.
 Upon reading one of my old probability books, I realized that what we
 are generating are really discrete probability *mass* functions.
 Density functions are continuous. So, I changed all references of PDF
 to PMF throughout the program and documentation.

v2.61  17-Apr-2001  M. Buhl
 Garrett Bywaters informed me that Crunch crashed whenever he tried to
 tabulate extreme events for aggregate analyses.  I tested it myself and
 found an error in the format specifier for tab-delimited output for that
 case.  I fixed the format in ExtEvent.f90\WriteEE() to solve the problem.
 In order to avoid having to recompile all routines that use the modules
 every time I modified the version number, I created a new routine called
 SetVersion.f90\SetVersion() that just sets the version number with an
 executable statement.  I put a call to the new routine in Crunch.f90\Crunch().

v2.62  04-Jun-2001  M. Buhl
 Jesse Stowell's keen eyes spotted a minor problem.  When generating tab-
 delimited extreme-event files, the channel titles weren't shifted enough
 to the right.  I modified ExtEvent.f90\WriteEE() to fix the problem.
 While fixing that, I noticed that we didn't get the headings for the first
 three columns (Parameter, Type, and File) when we didn't have units.  I
 fixed that too.

v2.70  14-Jun-2001  M. Buhl
 I added a peak-listing feature to the code.  I created a new file (PeakList.f90)
 to contain the main logic for it.  I also had to modify both DatMod and GenMod
 in Modules.f90.  I also modified Crunch() and GetParams() in Crunch.f90.

v2.71  21-Jun-2001  M. Buhl
 Garrett Bywaters discovered that things like the rainflow max range got
 used for the wrong columns when a constant channel was found in the
 list of channels to be rainflow counted.  I modified Rainflow.f90\Rainflow()
 so that it shifts that sort of information when a constant channel is found.

v2.72  06-Aug-2001  M. Buhl
 Dave Laino found that when files were skipped for having bad or insufficient
 data, the output file names got screwed up.  I added two lines to the main
 program to shift the names down when bad files were found.

v2.73  06-Sep-2001  M. Buhl
 Rick Santos found that when you don't use all the channels in an input file,
 calculated channels messed up the titles and units.  I changed "NumInCols" to
 "NumCols" in CalcChan.f90\AddCC() to fix the problem.

v2.80  02-Oct-2001  M. Buhl
 Rick asked me to add a random number generator to the calculated channels
 feature.  I modified Parser.f90\GetValue() and Parser.f90\tokenize() to look
 for the new function RAND().  I modified CalcChan.f90\CC_Init() to initialize
 the seed.  I modified Crunch.f90\GetParams() to read the seed in the CC
 section of the parameter input files.

v2.81  05-Mar-2002  M. Buhl
 I found that the program bombed when it was autocounting data records and
 no valid records were found.  I added an ELSEIF so that Crunch would do a
 tidy Abort() when it got an EOF on the first data record.

v2.82  21-Apr-2003  M. Buhl
 I eliminated all DATA statements.
 In order to get Crunch to compile on the Sun, I had to restrict all lines
  to 132 characters or less.
 We were using the non-standard CVF IsNaN() function, so I created a new
  logical function Is_NaN() and put it in the Sys*.f90 files.  For Sun, I
  invoked the INTEGER ID_NaN() function and tested its value to decide
  whether or not to return a true or false.
 I also discovered that I had mis-declared PLC in PL_Slope() as a REAL
  instead of an INTEGER when I tried to compile on the Sun.
 I found a bunch of lines that broke strings over multiple lines and had
  to fix them.

v2.83  15-Jul-2003  M. Buhl
 Jim Richmond had a problem when reading a file with no column titles.  It
  seems that I had neglected to allocate the Titles array before loading
  data into it.  I fixed that in Crunch.f90\DetectCols().
 After Garrett Bywaters mentioned that the 100 character limits for
  calculated-channel equations was an inconvenience, I upped it to 200.

v2.90  15-Oct-2003  P. Moriarty
 Pat added logic to allow users to set a weight to the unclosed (half) cycles.
  Setting the weight to 1 makes Crunch count them as full cycles.  Setting it
  to 0 makes Crunch discard the cycles.
 In the Peak Lister he added logic to output the last maximum or minimum in
  the time series.

v2.91  11-Mar-2004  M. Buhl
 I fixed a minor bug in an error message in Crunch.f90\GetParams().
 In Rainflow.f90\BinCount2(), I modified the equations that compute the bin
  indices so that the index would have a minimum value of 1.  This prevents
  the program from crashing when the user does not choose a wide enough range
  for the possible mean and range values.

v3.00.00  2007-04-06  M. Buhl
 I converted the program to use the NWTC Subroutine Library.
 In Rainflow.f90\SRain(), I had to modify the logic for moving the aggregate data
   into the Scratch() array.  I had been treating the multiple file data in the
   ConvData array as one long array and was exceeding subscript bounds.  It worked
   in the past because that was how things resided in memory, but when I turned on
   subscript bounds checking in Debug mode, it caught the error.  The checking is
   normally disabled in Release mode.
 I changed the array BadList from an integer to a string because we modify the
   FileName array by removing the names of bad files.  I have to modify
   Modules.f90\DataMod(), Crunch.f90\Crunch(), and Crunch_Subs.f90\WrBadList() to
   fix it.  Craig hansen discovered this bug.
 I added the ability to echo input files.  To accomodate the Echo flag in the Job
   Options section of the input file, I move the whole section above the Input-Data
   Layout section.
 Pat discovered a bug in the peak threshold stuff related to giving false error messages
   when reading in the parameters.  I modified Crunch_IO.f90/GetParams() to fix it.
 I discovered that when doing autocalculation of scales for PMFs, the min/max were't
   being recomputed for each file.  I was reusing the min/max from the first file.  This
   caused subscript out-of-bounds errors.  I created a new array called PMFAutoScl that
   is tested to see if we need to recompute the min/max for each file.
 I discovered that when the data files have different lengths, it causes the EEv tables to
   be messed up in that the file names in the tables appear to be right justified.  I
   modified ExtEvent.f90\WriteEE() to fix it.  I had forgotten that A format is right-
   justified!

v3.01.00b, 30-Nov-2012, M. Buhl
o  I Added the ability to read FAST binary files.
o  I changed the length of all paths, files, and roots to 1024 characters.
o  Oops!  I discovered that limiting by time does not work for formatted files.  Fixed it!

v3.01.00d, 19-Dec-2012, M. buhl
o  I created a makefile for gfortran
o  I fixed some stuff to get it to work with gfortran.

v3.02.00a-mlb, 10-Jan-2013,  M. Buhl
o  I created Crunch_RegTest.py so we could have a system-independent certification test.  I removed

o  I made a few mods to the .cru files and the python regression test to make them Linux compatible.
