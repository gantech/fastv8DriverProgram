False       FASTbin:            The flag that indicates if the input files are in FAST binary form.  Considered traditionally formatted if FALSE.  All records will be processed.
0           CTRow:              The row with the channel titles on it (zero if no titles are available of if titles are specified below, ignored if FASTbin is true).
0           CURow:              The row with the channel units on it (zero if no units are available of if units are specified below, ignored if FASTbin is true).
127         FDRow               The first row of data (ignored if FASTbin is true).
15001       NumRecs:            The number of data records to read from each file (0 to automatically determine which rows to read and if TEnd>0, ignored if FASTbin is true).
0.0, 0.0    TStart, TEnd:       The start and end times (enter zeros if you want to use all the data records in the file).

Format for moving-average info is: "Title" (10 char max), channel #, averaging period
"WS_MA", 2, 3

1 is the Time column.
2 is the primary wind-speed column (used for mean wind speed and turbulence intensity, 0 for none)

0 columns are to be azimuth averaged.  Next four lines ignored if 0.
0
0 is the number of azimuth bins.
0 is the azimuth column.
